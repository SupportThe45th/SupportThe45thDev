                <h1>President Donald Trump</h1>
                <h5>A president truly for the people</h5>
                <h2>A man passionate about the American people</h2>
                <p>In today's America, our governmental systems are poluted by corrupt politicians swimming in a swamp of lies, deceit and resentment for the american citizens.
                    Donald Trump was, and still is, the man they fear the most. President Trump went to bat for us Americans, giving up his life of luxury and comfort to take the 
                    political pollution head on. He withstood an entire presidential term of constant bashing and beratement from the liberal left and their fanatical followers, 
                    but he never gave up on us, the American people, the people he loves so dearly.
                </p>
                <h2 class = "right">An election stolen, democracy in jeopardy</h2>
                <p>The 2020 presidential election was nothing short of a travesty of justice. The liberal left plotted, schemed, and manipulated the election process and results
                    to ensure that their "candidate" was able to topple our president and everything he stands for. This election will go down in American history as the most disgraceful election every witnessed.
                    Joe Biden is not a president for the people, Joe Biden is a president for the communist Chinese regime, a president for foreign oil and increased fuel costs, and a president for insane gun control measures and stripping the American 
                    citizens of their god given right to bear arms. The liberal left knew that Trump would never allow them to push their agendas uncontested, so in true fashion, they cheated the election process to steal victory from the American people. 
                </p>
                <h2>Taking back our America</h2>
                <p>It is not only our right as American citizens, it is also our duty, to protect the democratic process. We can not stand by and allow the liberal left to do as they please. 
                    It is our duty to fight tooth and nail against their communistic and socialist agendas. It is our duty to take back our country from the evil menaces that currently plague our government.
